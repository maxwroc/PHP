My first PHP MVC framework created for my thesis. Adding it here just for fun and for myslef (I have lost it's final version when my HDD died - this is a backedup version from my old dropbox account).

It is based on CodeIgniter in terms of architecture but there is plenty of custom improvements (changed thisngs which I didn't like in the CI). 

The main reason I have wrote it was that I wanted to learn as much as possible. Code was written for few years (2-3) in my spare time between attending lectures and partying.
